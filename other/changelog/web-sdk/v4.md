### \[4.38.2] - 2024-12-18

#### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where the `floorNames` property on `Venue` objects could be null. This ensures venue objects always have valid floor names, preventing potential errors when accessing floor information.
* Fixed an issue where the `DirectionsRenderer` would throw an `Uncaught (in promise) Error: Invalid GeoJSON object!` error.
* Fixed an issue where setting the `venue` parameter for `LocationsService.getLocations()` would return an empty result.

### \[4.38.1] - 2024-12-12

#### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where calling `goTo` would reset the map's pitch/tilt. The map now retains the same pitch/tilt as it had before calling `goTo`. This was fixed in the `fitBounds` method on both `MapboxView` and `MapboxV3View`.

### \[4.38.0] - 2024-12-10

#### Added

* Added optional `automatedZoomLimit` property to `SolutionConfig`. The `automatedZoomLimit` controls how far the SDK automatically zooms in, e.g., when fitting to a venue, building, or location.
* Added the `goTo` method in the MapsIndoors class to improve the map navigation. This method fits the map view to a given feature with optional padding and a maximum zoom level. If the maximum zoom is not set when calling `goTo`, it will fall back to the `automatedZoomLimit` in the `SolutionConfig`. If neither is set, it will use the map's maximum supported zoom level.

#### Changed

* To improve performance, the strategy for loading data is changed from eager to lazy. This means the initial data load is much faster because the SDK only loads the data needed to render the initial map view. Then, when the map changes, more data is loaded as needed, e.g., if the floor is changed. This is an internal change and has been implemented without any changes to the SDK's public interface.

### \[4.37.1] - 2024-11-26

#### Fixed

* Fixed a potential `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`.
* Fixed typo in internal variable name that could cause unexpected behavior.

### \[4.36.3] - 2024-10-10

#### Fixed

* The SDK will no longer throw an error if the `venue.styles` property is undefined. This fixes a potential issue where the application might crash if the venue data was missing the styles property.

### \[4.36.2] - 2024-08-29

**Fixed**

    * **`optimize` parameter** (boolean, defaults to `false`): Optimizes the route for the shortest travel time.
  * The `mapsindoors.directions.DirectionsRenderer` has a new constructor parameter:
    * **`defaultRouteStopIconProvider`**: Sets the default route stop icon provider. Setting this parameter to `null` disables the rendering of default stop icons.
  * The `mapsindoors.directions.DirectionsRenderer.setRoute` now takes an extra parameter:
    * **`stopConfigs`**: A map of `RouteStopConfig` objects. The key is the stop index, and the value is the `RouteStopConfig` object.
