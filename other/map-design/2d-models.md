# 2D Models

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature must be enabled by MapsPeople. Contact your MapsPeople representative to activate it for your solution(s).
{% endhint %}

2D models are a way of including images on the map and customizing their appearance. They are uploaded using the Media Library.

The size of the 2D Models on the map follow the zoom levels, as opposed to how icons work, which always keep their size. The most common use case is to have logos for exhibitors, stores, or the like on the map.

{% hint style="info" %}
**On file size**

As 3D models, keep the file size of your 2D models as low as possible for the best performance. Compress your images using [https://tinypng.com/](https://tinypng.com/) before uploading them, and generally keep them under 800 px in width/height.
{% endhint %}

## Elevated 2D Models

If you enable an extrusion on a room or area along with a 2D model, the 2D model will automatically elevate to appear above the extrusion.
