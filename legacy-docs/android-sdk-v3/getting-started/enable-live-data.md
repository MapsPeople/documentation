# Enable Live Data

As opposed to _static data_, which does not change unless data is synchronized, Live Data can change in real time, and these changes can be instantly reflected on the map and in searches.

Common use-cases are:

* Changing the appearance of meeting rooms or workspace desks on a map, or in a list, based on occupancy information. For example, change the icon in order to indicate that a room is occupied.
* Changing the position of a POI representing a vehicle.

Support for Live Data requires that server-side integrations are in place. For example, visualizing live occupancy data requires that a calendar or booking system integration is in place. An integration like that is set up in [collaboration with MapsPeople](https://www.mapspeople.com/mapsindoors-integrations/).

The following section relies on the existence of Live Position Data. If you do not have access to a MapsIndoors Dataset that have a Live Data integration, you should use our demo API key: `d876ff0e60bb430b8fabb145`.

Enabling Live Data through `MapControl` is as simple as calling `mapControl.enableLiveData()` with a [Domain Type](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/android/v3/index.html).

We will create a new method on our `MapsActivity` called `enableLiveData()` to enable Live Data for the Solution.

* Java
* Kotlin

[MapsActivity.java](https://github.com/MapsPeople/MapsIndoors-Getting-Started-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/mapsindoorsgettingstarted/MapsActivity.java#L270-L278)

```
void enableLiveData() {
    //Enabling Live Data for the three known Live Data Domains enabled for this Solution.
    mMapControl.enableLiveData(LiveDataDomainTypes.AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN);
    mMapControl.enableLiveData(LiveDataDomainTypes.OCCUPANCY_DOMAIN);
    mMapControl.enableLiveData(LiveDataDomainTypes.POSITION_DOMAIN);
}
```

By consequence, `MapControl` will manage the Live Data subscriptions needed for the currently visible map and provide a default rendering of the Live Data updates depending on the Domain Type.

In the context of your view controller showing a map, add the call after creating your `MapControl` object used in the `Activity` in the `initMapControl()` method created earlier.

* Java
* Kotlin

[MapsActivity.java](https://github.com/MapsPeople/MapsIndoors-Getting-Started-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/mapsindoorsgettingstarted/MapsActivity.java#L148-L168)

```
void initMapControl(View view) {
        //Creates a new instance of MapControl
        mMapControl = new MapControl(this);
        //Enable Live Data on the map
        enableLiveData();
        ...
}
```

Using the demo API key you should now be able to see a "Staff Person" moving from one end to the other at ground floor in The White House main building.

### Summary[â€‹](https://docs.mapsindoors.com/getting-started/android/v3/livedata#summary) <a href="#summary" id="summary"></a>

Congratulations! You're at the end of your journey (for now), and you've accomplished a lot! ðŸŽ‰

* You learned which prerequisites is needed to start building with MapsIndoors.
* You loaded a interactive map with MapsIndoors locations and added a floor selector for navigating between floors.
* You created a search experience to search for specific locations on the map.
* You added functionality for getting directions from one Location to another.
* You learned how to enable different types of Live Data Domains in your app.

This concludes the "Getting Started" tutorial, but there's always more to discover.
