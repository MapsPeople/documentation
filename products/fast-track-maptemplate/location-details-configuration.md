# Location Details configuration

This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to configure the content displayed on the **Location Details** page in your web app.

When you load your solution in the web app, several pages are available — one of them is the Location Details page, which appears when a user selects a location on the map.

You can customize the content of the Location Details page directly in the CMS. This includes the **description**, **image**, and **additional details**. [This guide ](../cms/additional-location-details.md)will walk you through how to set up those additional details.

To display the additional details in the app, make sure the **“Show in app”** toggle is enabled.

In the image below, you can see how these settings are configured in the CMS.
