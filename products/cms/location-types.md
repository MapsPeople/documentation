# Location Types

Location types are used to **style** different locations on your map. You can create as many location types as needed and customize their styles individually.

To see available styling options, refer to the article on [display rules](display-rules.md), which are used to style your location types. For more information on location types, [go here.](interface-overview.md#types)
