**Editing options and differences based on Graph Setup:**

* **Manual** - having a Manual Graph setup means that your Route Network is drawn manually by MapsPeople.
* **Automatic** - having an Automatic Graph setup means that your Route Network is generated automatically based on the available route elements on the map.

Within the toolbar, you'll discover a variety of interactive buttons, each with a distinct function designed to enhance and customise your route network.

### The Toolbar actions

* **Show/Hide Route Network** - Clicking this button will load your route network if it is not visible, or hide it if it is already loaded. It will also be toggled on if other Route Element-related actions are being taken and the Network is not shown on the map. E.g. clicking Add Door Route Element also enables the Network for showing routing context on the Map.
