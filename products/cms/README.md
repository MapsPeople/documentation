# CMS

With the MapsIndoors CMS you can control the way your map looks in your apps. Specify the colors, icons, or 3d information about your Rooms, Areas, and POIs using [Display Rules](display-rules.md). Upload icons, set images on Locations, Buildings, and Venues, and manage integrations and API keys, all from the MapsIndoors CMS.

You can even make sure only some of your users will be able to see specific sections of your map using App User Roles, or direct your users through the best parts of your buildings by adding barriers on your network.
