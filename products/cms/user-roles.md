# User Roles

In the CMS, there are different levels of users, which affects what you have access to. For example, an "Admin" user can access Solution-level settings, whereas an "Editor" primarily can create and edit Locations on the Map.&#x20;

This documentation is written with an **Admin** user level in mind.

* **Administrator** - Administrators have full access to all menu points and options in this guide.
* **Editor** - Editors have more limited access than Administrators, being limited to creating new Locations alongside editing and deleting existing Locations. This gives you access to the following tools:
  * **Add POI** - Creates a Point of Interest by clicking on the Map. Afterwards, it opens an editor where Location details can be adjusted.
  * **Add Area** - Creates an Area by clicking on the Map to create corners of a polygon. Afterwards, it opens an editor where Area details can be adjusted.
  * All Display Filter options.
  * The following Location Editor Options:
    * **Type** - Locations must have a Type applied, which can be set in the Location details editor. When creating a new Location, some settings are inherited from the selected Type, e.g., Name and Icon. You can always change the inherited settings to something else if necessary.
    * **Name & Description** - Type in the name of your Location and a Description. Entering it in the default language is mandatory, but you also have the option to enter it in alternative languages.
    * **Categories** - Add which, if any, Categories this Location belongs to.
    * **External ID** - You can define an External ID that a Location should use alongside its internal ID.
    * **Area** - Choose the rotation of the Area the Location covers.
    * **Search** - Other search terms can be searched and still return this Location, even if it does not match the Name, Type, or Category.
    * **Restrictions** - Determine which, if any, App User Role Restrictions this Location should be subject to.
    * **Visibility** - If your Location is only displayed and searchable for a given period, you can define that here.
    * **Image** - Assign an image to be used for this Location.
    * **Custom Properties** - MapsIndoors supports Custom Properties, defined by key-value pairs.
    * **Details** - Select which Building and Floor this Location should belong to.
