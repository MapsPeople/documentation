title: State Display Rules Intro
---

The state Display Rules control how Locations in different states are displayed on the map. For example, you can change the icon scale of a Location to highlight it is part of a search result. The state Display Rules give access to the same properties as the regular Display Rules, which can be used to control the appearance of Locations.
