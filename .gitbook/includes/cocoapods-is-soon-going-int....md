{% hint style="warning" %}
CocoaPods is soon going into maintenance mode and we will stop releasing versions of the MapsIndoors SDK via CocoaPods some time in 2026. We will update you as soon as we know the exact timeline. You should use Swift Package Manager instead. See [#swift-package-manager](../../sdks-and-frameworks/ios/getting-started/create-a-new-project.md#swift-package-manager "mention") for information about using Swift Package Manager.
