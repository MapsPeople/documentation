# Built-In Map Edits

This extension allows your customers to make real-time updates to their indoor maps without leaving your application or requiring external assistance.

You maintain complete control over the implementation, including user interface design, permission structures, and functionality. The SDK provides the core mapping and editing capabilities, while you determine how these features appear and function within your product ecosystem.

This flexibility enables you to offer a seamless, fully integrated mapping experience that feels like a natural extension of your platform rather than a third-party tool. Your customers can easily manage common mapping tasks—such as renaming spaces, repositioning assets, changing location types, or adding new points of interest—all within your familiar interface.

Whether you're building workplace management software, event planning tools, or any platform that benefits from interactive indoor maps, Built-in Map Edits provides the foundation for creating a powerful, user-managed mapping experience.
