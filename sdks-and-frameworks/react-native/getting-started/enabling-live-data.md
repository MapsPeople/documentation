# Enabling Live Data

As opposed to _static data_, which does not change unless data is synchronized, Live Data can change in real time, and these changes can be instantly reflected on the map and in searches.

Common use-cases are:

* Changing the appearance of meeting rooms or workspace desks on a map, or in a list, based on occupancy information. For example, change the icon in order to indicate that a room is occupied.
* Changing the position of a POI representing a vehicle.

Support for Live Data requires that server-side integrations are in place. For example, visualizing live occupancy data requires that a calendar or booking system integration is in place. An integration like that is set up in [collaboration with MapsPeople](https://www.mapspeople.com/mapsindoors-integrations/).

The following section relies on the existence of Live Position Data. If you do not have access to a MapsIndoors Dataset that has a Live Data integration, you should use our demo API key: `d876ff0e60bb430b8fabb145` / White house demo.

Enabling Live Data through [`MapControl`](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/react-native/google-maps/1.0.0/classes/MapControl.html) is as simple as calling [`mapControl.enableLiveData()`](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/react-native/google-maps/1.0.0/classes/MapControl.html#enableLiveData).

We will create a new functions inside our `MapScreen` component called `livedata()` to enable Live Data for the Solution.

```
  const livedata = async () => {
    if (!mapControl) {
      console.warn("Must load MapsIndoors before enabling live data");
      return
    }

    await mapControl.enableLiveData('position');
    await mapControl.enableLiveData('availability');
    await mapControl.enableLiveData('occupancy');
  }
```

We can later call this function after loading MapsIndoors to enable it. For demonstration purposes we add a button inside the `MapScreen` that you can click to enable live data.

```
<GestureHandlerRootView style={{flex:1, flexGrow:1}}>
    <MapView style={{
      width: width,
      height: height,
      flex: 1,
    }}/>
    <View style={{position: 'absolute', bottom: 50, start: 10, flexDirection: 'column-reverse'}}>
      <Button title="livedata" onPress={livedata} />
    </View>
    ...
</GestureHandlerRootView>
```

By consequence, enabling live data through [MapControl](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/react-native/google-maps/1.0.0/classes/MapControl.html) is as simple as calling [mapControl.enableLiveData()](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/react-native/google-maps/1.0.0/classes/MapControl.html) will manage the Live Data subscriptions needed for the currently visible map and provide a default rendering of the Live Data updates depending on the Domain Type.

Using the demo API key you should now be able to see a "Staff Person" moving from one end to the other at ground floor in The White House main building.\

### Summary[â€‹](https://docs.mapsindoors.com/getting-started/React%20Native/livedata#summary) <a href="#summary" id="summary"></a>

Congratulations! You're at the end of your journey (for now), and you've accomplished a lot! ðŸŽ‰

* You learned which prerequisites is needed to start building with MapsIndoors.
* You loaded a interactive map with MapsIndoors locations and added a floor selector for navigating between floors.
* You created a search experience to search for specific locations on the map.
* You added functionality for getting directions from one Location to another.
* You learned how to enable different types of Live Data Domains in your app.

This concludes the "Getting Started" tutorial, but there's always more to discover.
