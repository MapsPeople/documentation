# Enable Live Data

As opposed to _static data_, which does not change unless data is synchronized, Live Data can change in real time, and these changes can be instantly reflected on the map and in searches.

Common use-cases are:

* Changing the appearance of meeting rooms or workspace desks on a map, or in a list, based on occupancy information. For example, change the icon in order to indicate that a room is occupied.
* Changing the position of a POI representing a vehicle.

Support for Live Data requires that server-side integrations are in place. For example, visualizing live occupancy data requires that a calendar or booking system integration is in place. An integration like that is set up in [collaboration with MapsPeople](https://www.mapspeople.com/mapsindoors-integrations/).

The following section relies on the existence of Live Position Data. If you do not have access to a MapsIndoors Dataset that have a Live Data integration, you should use our demo API key: `d876ff0e60bb430b8fabb145`.

Enabling Live Data through [`MapsIndoorsWidget`](https://pub.dev/documentation/mapsindoors\_googlemaps/latest/mapsindoors/MapsIndoorsWidget-class.html) is as simple as [calling `mapsindoorsWidget.enableLiveData`](https://pub.dev/documentation/mapsindoors\_googlemaps/latest/mapsindoors/MapsIndoorsWidget/enableLiveData.html) with a [Domain Type](https://pub.dev/documentation/mapsindoors\_googlemaps/latest/mapsindoors/LiveDataDomainTypes.html).

We will create a new method on our `MapState` called `enableLiveData` to enable Live Data for the Solution.

```dart
void enableLiveData() {
  _mapControl
    ..enableLiveData(LiveDataDomainTypes.availability.name)
    ..enableLiveData(LiveDataDomainTypes.occupancy.name)
    ..enableLiveData(LiveDataDomainTypes.position.name);
}
```

By consequence, `MapsIndoorsWidget` will manage the Live Data subscriptions needed for the currently visible map and provide a default rendering of the Live Data updates depending on the Domain Type.

In the context of your view controller showing a map, add the call after your `MapsIndoorsWidget` object is ready. Use the `onMapControlReady` method created earlier in `MapState`.\


{% hint style="info" %}
Due to a known issue with the latest iOS SDK, you will need to change floor before the livedata is shown
{% endhint %}

```dart
void onMapControlReady(MPError? error) async {
  if (error == null) {
    // with mapcontrol loaded, we can enable livedata
    enableLiveData();
     ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
}
```

Using the demo API key you should now be able to see a "Staff Person" moving from one end to the other at ground floor in The White House main building.

### Summary[â€‹](https://docs.mapsindoors.com/getting-started/flutter/livedata#summary) <a href="#summary" id="summary"></a>

Congratulations! You're at the end of your journey (for now), and you've accomplished a lot! ðŸŽ‰

* You learned which prerequisites is needed to start building with MapsIndoors.
* You loaded a interactive map with MapsIndoors locations and added a floor selector for navigating between floors.
* You created a search experience to search for specific locations on the map.
* You added functionality for getting directions from one Location to another.
* You learned how to enable different types of Live Data Domains in your app.

This concludes the "Getting Started" tutorial, but there's always more to discover.
