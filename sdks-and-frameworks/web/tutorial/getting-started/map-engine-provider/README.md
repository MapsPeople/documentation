# Map Engine Provider

MapsIndoors is built on top of an external map engine, either Mapbox or Google Maps.&#x20;

You'll need an Access Token for your chosen map engine with the relevant APIs enabled and a MapsIndoors API key to get started building your own app.\
\
You can use either Mapbox or Google Maps as your map provider. **You only need to obtain one type of token** - choose the provider that best suits your needs.

Token Options

* [Mapbox Token](option-1-get-your-mapbox-access-token.md)
* [Google Maps API Key](option-2-get-your-google-maps-api-keys.md)

**Note**: While both providers support core mapping features, some specialized functionality may only be available with a specific provider. These cases will be clearly marked throughout the documentation.

See the sections below for detailed setup instructions for your chosen provider:
