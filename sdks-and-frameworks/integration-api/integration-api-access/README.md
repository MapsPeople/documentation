# Integration API Access

The MapsIndoors Integration API can be accessed in multiple ways and is intended for programatic used. Sometimes it can be helpfull to make manual calls for debugging and learning the robes.

For this purpose a frontpage has been setup to experiment using [Swagger API documentation](https://swagger.io/solutions/api-documentation). This page shows the different endpoints available and contains working examples for each endpoint (using an example solution). Furthermore it's possible to get started in thirdparty apps like Postman by using the openapi profile we provide as part of Swagger.
